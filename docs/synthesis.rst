Data Synthesis
=================================

The currently supported data generation modules focus on GANs and combinations of (variational) autoencoders and GANs.

Traditional GANs include:

#. :ref:`DCGAN`
#. :ref:`RGAN`
#. :ref:`Recurrent DCGAN`

Traditional Autoencoder architectures include:

#. :ref:`Autoencoder`
#. :ref:`Variational Autoencoder`

GANs with autoencoder based generators include:

#. :ref:`Autoencoder GAN` (AEGAN/BeatGAN)
#. :ref:`VAEGAN`
